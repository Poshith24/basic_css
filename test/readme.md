In this folder I had tried to change the position of the  divs in the order of red,blue,yellow to blue,yellow and red using display and position properties in css
There are two ways to do this 
1. You can make divs inline-block so that you get the divs like inline elements and comes side by side as a train and and you can make divs relative to the desired positions.

2. You can make the body display flex and do the same instead making divs inline-block.
